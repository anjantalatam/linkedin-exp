# LinkedIn Exp

- A chrome extension to display overall experience of a LinkedIn user next to Experience text on Profile Page

## Problem Statement

- To reduce the human strain in calculating the experience of a person manually on LinkedIn

## Motivation

- Manier times when we want to know a person's experience from LinkedIn we need to scroll all the way to the bottom when a person has more than 3 experiences.
- Even if a person has 3 experiences or less we might not be interested doing those math to know the exact expertise of a person

## Usecase

- This chrome extension comes in handy for HRs who are looking out for candidates. HRs can get a quick idea on expertise of a person at a glance
- For any normal person on LinkedIn you can make best use of it when you look up to some persons on LinkedIn.
